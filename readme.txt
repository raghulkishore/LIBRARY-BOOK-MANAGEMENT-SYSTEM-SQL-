Library Book Management System (MySQL Only)

This project consists of a basic MySQL database to manage books, students, librarians, and borrow records in a library.
It includes four main tables: students, books, librarians, and borrow. 
The relationships between the tables support real-world scenarios such as students borrowing books through librarians. 
SQL queries include CRUD operations, JOINs for related data, and aggregate functions for statistics. 
The schema is simple and ideal for beginners learning database design and query formulation.
